Using Blender, I created a 3D model that represents the individual components and the materials from which the furniture piece will be constructed. Constructed from a combination of wood, plastic, and sturdy metal pipes, it has been fastened together using screws. This furniture piece boasts a comfortable foam cushion. It's designed to support the weight of an individual up to 100 kilograms (220.5 pounds), making it both stylish and sturdy for anyone to sit on. With the except of wallpaper this furniture piece is crafted exclusively from eco-friendly, recycled materials",
