Simply provide the server\'s IP address and the port on which the game should run. After entering both values, click "Set up," set your nickname, and click "Start." When all players in the room declare that they are ready to play, the game begins.',

In the game, you can move your character using the WASD keys and place bombs using the X key. At the start of the game, you have 3 hit points (HP), 1 explosion range, 1 speed, and more, but you can change these values through power-ups. You\'ll find power-ups where crates exploded. Below, there is a description of what each color of crate does. The game ends when there is only one player left alive. The game\'s source code is available on my GitHub.',
